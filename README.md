# Accessibility in HTML
## Andrew Newgard (Anders)

This challenge had us take existing HTML documentation and make it more accessible. 

This was done by changing all div tags to semantic elements. I also added alt attributes to images. 
Finally I changed the title of the website to be more descriptive, furthering accessibilty and SEO. 

Additionally, I commented out several sections off the styles.css file in order to help my understanding
in the functionality of the CSS attached to this webpage. 

Here is a link to the deployed webpage:

Below is a screenshot of the webpage.
