# module-1-challenge
## Andrew Newgard (Anders)

This challenge had us take existing HTML documentation and make it more accessible. 

This was done by changing all div tags to semantic elements. I also added alt attributes to images. 
Finally I changed the title of the website to be more descriptive, furthering accessibilty and SEO. 

Here is a link to the project: https://anewgard41.github.io/module-1-challenge/

Thanks for reading!
