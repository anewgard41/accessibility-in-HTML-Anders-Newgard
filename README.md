# Accessibility in HTML
## Andrew Newgard (Anders)

This challenge had us take existing HTML documentation and make it more accessible. 

This was done by changing all div tags to semantic elements. I also added alt attributes to images. 
Finally I changed the title of the website to be more descriptive, furthering accessibilty and SEO. 

Additionally, I commented out several sections off the styles.css file in order to help my understanding
in the functionality of the CSS attached to this webpage.

Above is a link to the deployed webpage with all of my edits incorporated. 

Thanks for reading! 

Cheers,

Anders
